# Heritability of Cerebellar Volumes in Adolescent and Young Adult Twins
Analysis code for Strike et al., (2023). Heritability of Cerebellar Volumes in Adolescent and Young Adult Twins.

## Saturated
Saturated models to test twin modelling assumptions and covariate effects and estimate correlations between twin pairs. 
Expects five zygosity groups (MZF, MZM, DZF, DZM, DZOS). Combined and QTIM scripts additionally expect one singleton sibling of twins.
Covariate coefficients and twin correlations were obtained from saturated models with equal means and variances across birth order, zygosity, and twins/singletons siblings of twins.

## Univariate
Variance component estimates (ACE or ADE). Uses direct estimates of variance components (i.e., negative estimates are permitted).

## Bivariate
